This is all about:

     1. Creating a reusable component which has date prop.
     2. Rendering the component by passing the prop value.
     3. Calendar module is used from react-calendar.
     4. Written test cases for the requirement given .

Requirement in Detail:

 - A reusable calendar component which has a `date` prop.
 - The first row of the calendar should display the `date` prop's month and year.
 - The second row of the calendar should display the days of the week, one per column.
 - The following rows should display the dates for the `date` prop's month and year, appropriately aligned with the day headings.
 - The appropriate date cell should be highlighted based on the `date` prop.

- Showing the component can take a date prop and renders the correct calendar through a set of component tests. You may use tools such as `react-testing-library` to achieve this.
